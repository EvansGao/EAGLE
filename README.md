# EAGLE
EAGLE used all six features only derived from the enhancers and gene expression datasets, without providing more information like histone modification, methylation or other enhancer/promoter-related detection datasets. With a high accuracy thirteen times larger than employing the closest genes, EAGLE could correctly identify the individual enhancer-gene interactions across 110 and 89 tissue/cell types in human and mouse, respectively.
